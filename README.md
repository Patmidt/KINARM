# KINARM
This repository contains all the code needed to run an experiment task with aVNS on the KINARM device and also features code to analyze the KINARM data.

To set up the environment, use pip install -r requirements.py.

The data storage is coded in the scripts and uses the local directoy of the saved files. In order to continue working on the experiment,
the device has to be connected to the P-Drive so that the files can be stored there and there is no confusion.
