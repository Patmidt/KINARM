# KINARM
This repository contains all the code needed to run an experiment task with aVNS on the KINARM device and also features code to analyze the KINARM data.

Create a new folder with the name "KINARM". Download the code and move it into a folder named "Experiment_Code". Also add a folder called "Data" in the KINARM folder. In the "Experiment_Code" folder, add the folder # TO DO

To set up the environment, use pip install -r requirements.py. A few scripts require access to data stored on the Skaaltec P-Drive. If the user of this repository doesn't have said access, the code will not work.

If you are using an Apple device, use a conda environment with Python 3.10.

Your directory will need a couple of folders that you have to manually add.
