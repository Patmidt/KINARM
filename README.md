# KINARM
This repository contains all the code needed to run an experiment task with aVNS on the KINARM device and also features code to analyze the KINARM data.

To set up the environment, use pip install -r requirements.py. A few scripts require access to data stored on the Skaaltec P-Drive. If the user of this repository doesn't have said access, the code will not work.

If you are using an Apple device, use a conda environment with Python 3.10.
